#  Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository showcases my skills and expertise as a developer/programmer. I have been actively involved in the tech industry since 2021, working with various tech teams and startups. I specialize in full-stack development and mobile app development, with proficiency in over 10 different technologies including React, Node.js, Flutter, Tailwind CSS, and Express.js.

## Technologies I Work With

Here's a list of the technologies I have hands-on experience with:

1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I have built several web applications using React, leveraging its component-based architecture and efficient virtual DOM rendering.

2. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that enables server-side development. I have created RESTful APIs and backend systems using Node.js, along with frameworks like Express.js.

3. Flutter: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. I have developed cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter, enabling fast and responsive experiences.

4. Tailwind CSS: A highly customizable CSS framework that provides utility classes for rapidly building user interfaces. I have utilized Tailwind CSS to create visually appealing and responsive designs for web applications.

5. Express.js: A flexible and minimal web application framework for Node.js. I have used Express.js to build server-side applications and RESTful APIs, taking advantage of its simplicity and robust middleware support.

## Projects

Here are a few notable projects I have worked on:

1. Reeda: A web application that offers free eBooks. Built with PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.

2. OneSync: A mobile and desktop app that syncs the file system of two devices and enables sharing of files, clipboard and drag and drop of files. Built with Flutter and Dart.

3. diko-mini-framework: A mini framework like bootstrap that provides easy to use, pre written css classes for easy styling.
